            <p>
              Born and raised in Arizona, I moved to Colorado at 18, relocating
              to Denver a year later. Working for the dental industry,
              coordinating dental insurance for a local office for two years. I
              decided that is not what I wanted to do with the rest of my life,
              so I looked into programs to give me valuable and applicable
              skills that I could use in the work force. I've always been a
              problem solver and have always enjoyed that aspect of the coding
              world. Now, working full time, I am an aspiring Web Developer.
            </p>

              Though I am dedicated to my school and furthing myself and my
              career I am not just a coder. I am a proud mother of two...cats.
              Mia (shamelessly named after Mia Thermopolis from 'The Princess
              Diaries') and Berlioz (AKA Little B...because sometimes he is a
              little b). I am also a huge book nerd and musical geek. When I
              have the time, I've been known to hole myself up and read as many
              as 8 books a week. I know...maybe a little much, but it's what I
              do. I studied musical theatre in school. That has been my main
              passion for as long as I can remember, and that continues to be
              true even today.
            </p>

            <p>
              Although I love nerding out on my books or musicals, I also am
              very into athletics. Don't hate me Denver, but I am loyal
              DiamondBacks fan...not the Rockies. As much of a spectator I am I
              also enjoy playing the sport with friends. I am a person of very
              vast hobbies and intrests and look forward to what my future
              holds.
